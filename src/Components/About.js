       At Align Technology, we believe a great smile can transform a person’s life, <br />so we create technology that gives 
       people the confidence to take on whatever’s next.
     </p>

     <p className="aboutDetails">We revolutionized the orthodontic industry with the introduction of the Invisalign system,<br /> 
       and we have never lost sight of that spirit of innovation. <br />
       Our teams are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible—from 3D printing technology to new aligner <br /> 
       materials and new software algorithms that determine the optimal way to move teeth digitally—with <br />
       one goal in mind: to help you get the smile you want.<br />
      </p>

  
     <p className="aboutDetails">Together with nearly 100,000 Invisalign-trained orthodontists and dentists in more than 90 countries, <br />we have 
        transformed over 7 million smiles. And that’s just the beginning.
     </p>


    <p className="aboutDetails">We use the data from those millions of smiles and countless individual tooth movements to uncover <br />
      insights that lead to more innovative ways to straighten teeth, including faster treatment times. <br />
      And we believe we have the potential to enable and improve almost every type of orthodontic treatment for almost<br />
      every kind of smile.
